                          Discuss the scope of var, let, and const

                <div class=" mx-10"> 
                <p class="text-2xl">In JavaScript, var, let, and const are used for variable declaration, and they have  different scopes and behaviors.  Understanding <br> their scope is crucial for writing clean and maintainable code. Let's discuss the scope of each of these variable declarations: <br>
      
                1. var:
                Function Scope: Variables declared with var are function-scoped, which means they are visible within the function in which they are declared. <br>
                Hoisting: Variables declared with var are hoisted to the top of their containing function or global context. This means that you can access them <br> before  they are actually declared in your code, but their value will be undefined until they are assigned a value.
                No Block Scope: Unlike let and <br> const, var does not  have block-level scope. If you declare a var variable inside a block (e.g., within an if statement), it is visible throughout the <br> entire function or global context. <br>
                Example:</p>
                <div class="mockup-code my-2 mx-auto">
                          <pre><code>
                          function exampleFunction() {
                          if (true) {
                          var x = 10; // Function-scoped
                          }
                          console.log(x); // 10 (visible outside the if block)
                          }
                                  </code></pre>
                        </div>
                <p class=text-2xl>
                          2. let:
                          Block Scope: Variables declared with let have block-level scope, meaning they are only visible  within the block in which they <br> are defined (e.g., inside curly braces).
                          No Hoisting Issues: Unlike var, let variables are not hoisted to the top of their containing block. <br> This prevents the "temporal dead zone" and ensures that you cannot access a let variable before it's declared in the code. <br>
                          Reassignment: let variables can be reassigned with new values after their initial declaration. <br>
                          Example:
                </p>
                <div class="mockup-code my-2 mx-auto my-2">
                          <pre><code>
                          function exampleFunction() {
                          if (true) {
                          let y = 20; // Block-scoped
                          }
                          console.log(y); // Error: y is not defined (not visible outside the if block)
                          }
                          </code></pre>
                        </div>
                <p class="text-2xl">
                          3.const:
                          Block Scope: Similar to let, variables declared with const are block-scoped. <br>
                          No Reassignment: const variables, as the name suggests, are constant, meaning their value cannot be changed or reassigned after declaration. <br> However, it's important to note that for objects and arrays declared with const, you can still modify their properties or elements; you just can't <br> reassign the variable itself to a new value.
                          No Hoisting Issues: Like let, const variables are not hoisted to the top of their containing block. <br>
                          Example:
                </p>
                <div class="mockup-code my-2 mx-auto">
                          <pre><code>
                          function exampleFunction() {
                          if (true) {
                          const z = 30; // Block-scoped and constant
                          // z = 40; // Error: Assignment to a constant variable
                          }
                          console.log(z); // Error: z is not defined (not visible outside the if block)
                          }
                          </code></pre>
                        </div>
                <P class="text-xl">
                In summary, the scope of var is function-level, let and const have block-level scope, and const additionally enforces immutability for the variable itself. <br> It's generally recommended to use let or const over var in modern JavaScript, as they provide more predictable and scoped behavior. The choice between <br> let and const depends on whether you expect the variable's value to change after initialization.

                  <h3>Answer:</h3>
                  <p>A REST API (Representational State Transfer Application Programming Interface) is a design architecture for creating web services that can be used with various programming languages. It follows a set of principles and constraints to build scalable and maintainable networked applications.</p>
      
                  <p>Key characteristics of a REST API include resource-based identification, the use of HTTP methods for actions, statelessness, a uniform interface, and multiple data representations. RESTful APIs are widely used for building web services that allow clients to interact with resources over HTTP.</p>
      
                  <p>In JavaScript, you can interact with REST APIs using methods like Fetch or Axios to make HTTP requests and retrieve or send data to these APIs.</p>
